This is my newer personal portfolio website, coded from the ground up on top of a [Next.js base template.](https://nextjs.org/docs)

My first attempt at this was more of a separated website, with a home page and sections for photography, design, etcetera. This time I chose to go for a simpler landing page, with my projects listed and my capabilities on display.
